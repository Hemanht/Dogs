<b><h2> PART 1. Feeding a Dog</h2></b><br/>

<b><h3>1.Feed your dog a high quality dog food.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic1.jpeg">
<p>  a.Read the label of a prospective food.<br/>
     b.The first couple ingredients should be some kind of meat, not meat by-product or a grain.<br/>
     c.This will help you know that the food is high in good protein, not just filler.<br/>
     d.Your vet may be able to steer you towards a food that is just right for your
     pup and he or she may also have recommendations for how much to feed the dog.<br/>
</p>   <br/><br/><br/><br/>
</div>
<div class="f">
<b><h3>2.Feed your dog on a regular schedule.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic2.jpeg">
<p>  a.It is recommended that you feed your dog twice a day.<br/>
     b.Figure out the proper amount you should be feeding your dog daily, which is usually on the dog food package, and divide that amount in two.<br/>
     c.Feed your dog the first half in the morning and the second half in the evening.<br/>
     d.A stable routine of feeding can also help you with house training.<br/>
     e.Dogs usually have to go to the bathroom 20 - 30 minutes after eating.<br/>
</p>
</div>
<br/><br/>
<div class="e">
<b><h3>3.Avoid giving your dog an excessive amount of treats or people food.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic3.jpeg">
<p>This can lead to weight gain or health problems for your pet.<br/>
     Stick to the rule of only giving your dog treats when you're training it.<br/>
     Remember, this can be hard to follow, especially if your pup is looking at you with puppy dog eyes. However, stick to your guns!<br/>
    Don't feed your dog food that is bad for it. There are many foods that are not only bad for your dog but that can be hazardous to its health.<br/>
     Do not give your dog any chocolate, avocado, bread dough, raisins, grapes, onions, or xylitol, which is a non-caloric sweetener.<br/>
</p>
</div>
<div class="f">
<b><h3>4.Give your dog water.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic4.jpeg">
<p>
     Food is not the only thing your dog needs to survive. Water is just as, if not more, important.<br/>
     Give your dog open access to water at all times. This doesn't mean that you have to give it access 
   to water when it is unfeasible, for instance when you are in the car, but if it is possible you should 
   supply a bowl of clean drinking water
</p>
</div>
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<center><b><h2>PART 2.Caring For the Health of a Dog</h2></b></center><br/><br/>
<div class="e">
   <b><h3>1.Make sure you have a good, reliable veterinarian.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic5.jpeg">
<p>
    A good way to choose a vet is to see if he or she answers your questions promptly and knowledgeably and to see how they interact with your pet.<br/>
    You will need to bring your dog for regular check-ups, so if your vet is too booked up you may want to look for a new one.<br/>
       Feel free to change veterinarians even after you take your dog to one.<br/>
Remember, you should also know of an emergency vet that's open 24 hours a day and on weekends.<br/>

</p>
</div><br/><br/>
<div class="f">
<b><h3>2.Get your dog vaccinated.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic6.jpeg">
<p>
    Your veterinarian will advise you as to which diseases are common in the area and so which diseases it is necessary to vaccinate against.<br/>
    Typically, vaccinations are kept up to date with regular booster injections, which may either be yearly or three-yearly, depending on the disease.<br/>
    Most U.S. states require you to vaccinate the dog against rabies.<br/>
    Even if this isn't a legal requirement, it is a good idea in order to protect your pet (and you) from this deadly disease.<br/>
</p>
</div>
<div class="e">
<b><h3>3.Consider fitting the dog with an ID chip. </h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic7.jpeg">
<p>
    This is a small microchip that is injected under the skin over the shoulder blades.<br/>
    Each chip has a unique number that is registered on a data base with your contact details. <br/>
    In the event of the pet being lost or stolen, the chip is a means of matching you with the dog and proving your ownership.<br/>
</p>
</div>
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

<div class="f">
<b><h3>4.Use regular parasite preventative treatments.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic8.jpeg">
<p>
    It important to treat regularly with basic worming against roundworms.<br/>
    Exactly how often depends on your pet's lifestyle. An indoor dog is at lower risk than a hunting dog of picking up worms,
    and this will influence your vet's advice about how often to deworm.<br/>
    A low risk dog may only need a round worming treatment two or three times a year, 
   whereas a high risk dog may need monthly treatments.<br/>
    Also consider other risks such as heartworm.Also use flea preventative treatments and, if you live in a tick area, 
   use a product that also kills ticks.
</p>
</div>
<div class="e">
<b><h3>5.Consider desexing your dog.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic9.jpeg">
<p>
    This reduces the risk of certain health disorders, such as mammary cancer (if neutering performed before the second season) 
   and pyometra (pus in the womb) in females, and aggression and prostatic disease in the male. <br/>
    It is also the responsible thing to do, as it reduces the problem of accidental breeding and pet overpopulation.<br/>
    Be aware that desexed dogs are actually at higher risk for some health problems. For example,
    your desexed dog may be at more risk for certain types of cancers and thyroid problems, as well as cardiac problems.
     Consider this carefully.<br/>
</p>
</div>
<div class="f">
<b><h3>6.Get pet health insurance.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic10.jpeg">
<p>
    If  you would struggle to meet the cost of veterinary treatment then take out a pet insurance policy.<br/>
    In exchange for a monthly premium, if the pet is sick or injured the insurance company will cover the
    majority of the costs involved up to a certain limit.<br/>
    The exact nature of policies and the amount they cover varies widely.Do your homework. De
   cide how much you can afford each month for a premium and investigate several companies to see what level
    of coverage they will provide.<br/>
</p>
</div>
<center><b><h2>Part 3. Grooming a Dog</h2></b></center>
<div class="e">
<b><h3>1.Brush your dog.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic11.jpeg">
<p>
    The frequency of brushing will vary widely, depending on what type of dog you have and how much it sheds.<br/>
    Brushing your dog regularly will help to reduce shedding and it gives you a chance to assess the state of your dog's body.<br/>
    Your aim is to keep the coat in good condition and knot free.<br/>
    For this you may need a combination of comb and brush, to prevent knots and groom out tangles.<br/>
    If your dog sheds a lot, pet stores and Walmart sell shed-control shampoo. Bathe shedding dogs once a week until shedding reduces.<br/>
</p>
</div>
<div class="">
<b><h3>2.Keep your dog's coat clean.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic12.jpeg">
<p>
    Dirty coats can lead to secondary skin infections, so be prepared to bathe your dog with a mild dog shampoo if it gets really dirty.<br/>
    Most dogs don't need baths more than once every month or so, but this varies widely depending on breed and activities.<br/>
    Know that your dog's coat may grow and it will need to be trimmed by a dog groomer. If the fur grows too long it can irritate the dog between the toes, or prevent it from seeing properly.<br/>
    In addition, the dog is likely to sweep debris, such as sticks and grass, up in the coat, which could cause it discomfort.<br/>
</p>
</div>
<div class="e">
<b><h3>3.Keep your dog's nails trimmed.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic13.jpeg">
<p>
    It may be difficult to trim your dog's nails but it is important to keeping its paws healthy.<br/>
    Take it slow and steady, making sure to keep your cuts away from the quick, the inner part of the nail that is still alive.<br/>
    Cutting the quick could make your dog very, very resistant to nail trims in the future.<br/> 
    Train your dog to associate nail trims with good things. Give your pup a treat after trimming or take it on a trip to the park. 
   Whatever you do, make sure to stay upbeat during the trim, no matter how hard it is to trim your pup's nails.<br/>
 </p>
</div>
 
 <center><b><h2>part4. Exercising, Socializing, and Playing With Dogs</h2></b></center>
 <div class="d">
<b><h3>1.Provide your dog with plenty of exercise.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic14.jpeg">
 <p> <h3>Provide the right amount of exercise for the type of dog you have.<br/>
     A small toy dog may be better playing games of fetch or ball to tire it out, while a Labrador needs to have good long walks, for at least 30 - 45 minutes twice a day in order to burn its energy.<br/>
     You may have a dog that actually requires a ton of exercise and never tires out, for example terriers are often capable of running all day without tiring.<br/>
     Lots of exercise helps burn off excess energy, which, if unattended, could cause behavioral problems, such as chewing, digging, or excess barking.<br/>
     Make sure you walk your dog. Your dog should go on at least two small walks or one BIG walk a day. The length of these walks varies depending on the type of dog you have.<br/>
     No one wants their dog to run away. If you have a yard and you allow your dog to be outside by itself make sure you have a fence in your yard so the dog can't run away. <br/>
     Make sure it's tall enough for your dog not to jump over the fence.<br/></h3>
</p>
</div>
<div class="e">
<b><h3>2.Stimulate your dog's mind with reward-based training.</h3></b> 
<img src="pic/pic15.jpeg">
<p>   Just like people, dogs can get bored. To lead a happy life dogs need mental stimulation. This stimulation can be in the form of obedience training.<br/>
     It is important to teach your dog to sit, stay, and come when called.Most dogs enjoy the one-to-one attention of a training session and these sessions help the dog to bond with you. <br/>
     If you use reward-based training, in which only correct behavior is rewarded and no punishment is used, the experience of training will be a very happy and positive one for your pup.<br/>
    Train for around 10-20 minutes twice a day, depending on the concentration span of your dog. Always try to end each session on a positive note.<br/>
Give your dog a reward each time it obeys your command. You can use small treats (remembering not to over feed your dog) or you can simply shower the dog with love when it does something correctly.
 The choice of reward depends on what motivates your specific dog.<br/>

</p>
</div>
<div class="d">
<b><h3>3.Socialize your dog.</h3></b>
<img src="pic/pic16.jpeg">
<p>
     Dogs need to be well socialized in order to become well-adjusted adults.<br/>
     From just a few weeks of age introduce the pup to as many different people, sights, sounds, and smells as you can.<br/>
     What it encounters up through 18 weeks of age (when the socialization window closes) it will largely regard as normal and not be fearful of in the future.<br/>
     If you got the dog as an adult then still introduce it to different experiences.
     Take care not to overwhelm the dog and make it fearful if it is not comfortable. 
     This requires patient handling whereby you introduce the dog to the fearful objec
     t, but at sufficient distance that it does not alarm the dog. Reward calm behavior and,
      over time, move the object closer, rewarding as you go, so it starts to build a positive association with the object.<br/>
</p>
</div>
<div class="e">
 <b><h3>4.Allow the dog to play and display behaviors that are normal for the breed</h3></b>
 <img src="pic/pic17.jpeg">
 <p>
  For example, scent hounds, such as Bassets and Bloodhounds, love to follow scent. Make sure you give your dog time to sniff its environment. 
  You may even wish to turn this into a game where you lay a scent trail and it gets to follow it.
